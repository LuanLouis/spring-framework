/**
 * Spring对某一资源的抽象
 *
 * Interface for a resource descriptor that abstracts from the actual
 * type of underlying resource, such as a file or class path resource.
 *
 * <p>An InputStream can be opened for every resource if it exists in
 * physical form, but a URL or File handle can just be returned for
 * certain resources. The actual behavior is implementation-specific.
